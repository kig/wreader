Installation
------------

Copy the contents of cgi-bin to your webserver's CGI directory.
Make a pdfs/ subdir to the CGI directory, and make it writable 
by the CGI script user account (e.g. www-data.)
Copy a pdf to pdfs/ and point your browser to 
http://myhost/my_cgi_dir/reader.cgi?item=pdfs/mypdf.pdf

Hack in an upload system and metadata storage system, etc.

To read non-PDFs, you need to create PDF files of them:
use `thumbnailer -s 128 -k my.ppt my.ppt.png` (and you
get a nice thumbnail to boot!)
